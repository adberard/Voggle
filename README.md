# Voggle

This plugin can toggle from one thing to another.
For example:  
	`True <-> False`  
	`== <-> !=`  
	`+ <-> -`  

It will (try to) toggle whatever item the cursor is over when `:Voggle` is called.  
So you can just bind that to some key with for example: `nmap t :Voggle<Enter>`  

You can also toggle between more than 2 things, like: `A -> B -> C -> A`

This plugin was made mostly for personal use and for me to learn some basic vimscript, but feel free to use it and/or give me suggestions.
